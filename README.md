# Deep learing with wine dataset
## Overview 
In this challenge the goal was to get a working deep learning program running with the wine dataset that was given. Using the various ingreediants we wanted to predict what the quality of the wine would be. 

Dataset: 
| Features           | format         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| fixed acidity | float64 | 
|  volatile acidity | float64 | 
|  citric acid | float64 | 
|  residual sugar | float64 | 
|  chlorides  | float64 | 
|  free sulfur dioxide |float64 |  
|  total sulfur dioxide |float64 |  
|  density | float64 | 
|  pH | float64 | 
|  sulphates | float64 | 
|  alcohol | float64 | 
| quality (score between 0 and 10) | int |
