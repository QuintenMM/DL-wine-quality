# Deep learning - Wine Quality challenge

- Repository: `DL-wine-quality`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`
- Deployment strategy :
  - GitHub page
- Team challenge : `solo`


## Mission objectives

- Use a deep learning library
- Prepare a data set for a machine learning model
- Put together a simple neural network
- Tune parameters of a neural network


That is why we put together this project to let an AI predict the quality of a wine.

### Must-have features

- Use `pytorch` or `keras` to build the model.
- The model is able to train.
- A baseline model is built using a simple neural network and the original dataset.
- The code is formatted using `black`.



The dataset is already cleaned and has no missing values. You can do whatever you want to increase the score of the model.
There are multiple things to try:

- Define the problem as a classification problem
- Define the problem as a regression problem
- Feature engineering
- Feature normalization
- Resampling
- Hyper-parameter tuning
  - Change the learning rate
  - Change the loss function
  - etc...
- Modify the architecture
  - Number of layers
  - Number of neurons per layer
  - Activation functions
  - etc...
- etc...

In machine learning, it is customary to have a [baseline model](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/always-start-with-a-stupid-model-no-exceptions-3a22314b9aaa).
**Thus, the first step of this project is to get a very simple architecture to work with the standard, unmodified data.**

**Then** you can do all the above to get better performance.


### Steps

1. Create the repository.
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
